	//This exercises full startup with no mocking in place whatsoever BUT as you add remote systems to 
	//talk to, you will need to change this test and pass in appOverridesModule to override those 
	//pieces.  In this test, we literally bind a port.  We only do this in one or two tests just to
	//ensure full server basic functionality is working.  All other tests create a server and pass
	//in http requests directly.  This test can use http client to send requests in which exercises
	//our http parser and other pieces (which sometimes can catch bugs when you upgrade webpieces
	// so in some cases, this can be valuable)

		//ALSO, it is completely reasonable to create a brand new instance(ie. avoid statics and avoid

		//while a java singleton....well, pretty much sucks.  Google "Singletons are evil".
