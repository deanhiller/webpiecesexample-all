This file serves as a locator so as we run we can figure out where things are.
Intellij proved the most difficult as it chooses odd locations to run from while
eclipse and gradle actually run from the same locations(kind of the location you would
think actually...the subproject directory you ran the server in).

Since we run in many environments, it can be hard to locate html resources that
come from the filesystem(clearly classpath resources are easy but many images are 
served off the filesystem).  Also, we need to know where the dynamic html files
are for the Development Server
